# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio website, whose purpose is to showcase my work and skills of being a software engineer.

## Description

My motivations for building this site were to showcase my projects while displaying my 'bouncy/bubbly' personality. I knew that building a portfolio site is an important and essential asset for being a software engineer. This allows future employers to have a more detailed/transparent way to learn more about me and the work I have done.
Please enjoy!

## Usage

The web-page features links in its nav-bar that scrolls the UI to different sections of the page: "About-me", "Projects", and "Contact-me".

The "About Me" section includes three ways to contact me; email, LinkedIn, and my Github repository.

The "Projects" section features four images that are nested in a 2X2 grid. Each time you hover over an image, it will 'blur'. bounce, and 'fade in' the name of the project in the center of it.

The website also has a responsive layout, based on the screen/Max-width size.

- When the page is viewed in full screen/1212px or higher, the page will display in its default layout (as shown in the screenshot below)

- When the page is viewed in a Max-width of 1211px or lower, the "project section's" container will stack all its contents in a column (as seen in the screenshot).
- The #project-2 and #project-3 images will no longer have a border radius, but the top and bottom images have the curved borders.
- Also the project's name will appear automatically without having to hover over it.

- When the page is viewed in a Max-width of 720px or lower, the "About-me" section is transitioned to a 'flex-direction' column and all of its contents are centered (as shown in the screenshot below)
